# Weather App
This is one of my first IOS projects (the old one).  
The app provides with the temperature, "feel like" temp and condition info (rain, snow, smoke) in a user's city or a city typed with the keyboard.   

### About: 
- Weather API: openweathermap.org
- Core Location:
    - After launching the app asks for a permission to use a user's location data (CLLocationManager)
    - The CLLocationManagerDelegate was used to update the user's location every time
    - The current weather is fetched by 2 Request Types: by the city name and by latitude and longitude (in case of Core Location feedback)   
- Dark and Light Modes
